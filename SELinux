SELinux stands for “Security-Enhanced Linux“. Standard Linux security is based on Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

SELinux was created by the US National Security Agency to provide a finer-grained level of control over files, processes, 
users, and applications in the system. It is an enhancement to the Linux kernel, and it implements a different type of security called 
Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC policy is centrally managed rather than being managed by the user.

Enforcing: Access is denied to users and programs unless permitted by SELinux security policy rules.
Permissive: The security policy rules are not enforced, but SELinux sends denial messages to a log file.
Disabled: SELinux does not enforce a security policy because no policy is loaded in the kernel. Only DAC rules are used for access control.

#sestatus 
#getenforce 
#setenforce

SELinux also provides “Booleans“, which allow parts of a SELinux policy to be changed at run time, 
without reloading or recompiling a SELinux policy. You can display a list of Booleans as 
# semanage boolean -l
# setsebool ftpd_use_nfs on
# getsebool ftpd_use_nfs
