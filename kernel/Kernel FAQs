1 How are the command line arguments passed to Linux kernel by the u-boot (bootloader)?


2 Explain about command line arguments that are passed to linux kernel and how/where they are parsed in kernel code?

The kernel parses parameters from the kernel command line and passed as cmd line arguments to init.

Module parameters can be specified in two ways: via the kernel command line with a module name prefix, or via modprobe.
(kernel command line) usbcore.blinkenlights=1
(modprobe command line) modprobe usbcore blinkenlights=1

Parameters for modules which are built into the kernel need to be specified on the kernel command line.
modprobe looks through the kernel command line (/proc/cmdline) and collects module parameters when it loads a module, 
so the kernel command line can be used for loadable modules too.
arameters may be changed at runtime by the command echo -n ${value} > /sys/module/${modulename}/parameters/${parm}.

parsing of arguments: init/main.c  parse_args() -> kernel/params.c -> parse_one()

3 Explain about device tree:
data structure describing the hardware components, so that the operating system's kernel can use and manage those.
located in arch/arm/boot/dts/ . also contains include files in the form of .dtsi

Datastruture  is a tree of named nodes and properties. Nodes contain properties and child nodes, while properties are nameâ€“value pairs.

The purpose is to move a significant part of the hardware description out of the kernel binary, 
and into the compiled device tree blob, which is handed to the kernel by the boot loader, 
replacing a range of board-specific C source files and compile-time options in the kernel.

The Device Tree Compiler (DTC) is the tool(scripts/dtc) that is used to compile the source into a binary form. 
The output of the device tree compiler is a device tree blob (DTB), 
which is a binary form that gets loaded by the boot loader and parsed by the Linux kernel at boot.

parse dtb  by kernel:  uEnv.txt Boot script  file having boot configurations, by which u-boot pass cmdline args and dtb.
setenv bootargs 'console=tty0 console=ttyO2,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait rootfstype=ext4 rw'
fatload mmc 0:1 0x80300000 zImage
fatload mmc 0:1 0x815f0000 beagle-xm.dtb
bootz 0x80300000 - 0x815f0000
