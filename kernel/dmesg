dmesg works by Daemon rsyslogd , which will track ring buffer and write to /var/log/dmesg
dmesg -k prints kernel space logs
dmesg -u prints only userspace
dmesg -C clears ring buffer
dmesg -c clears buffer after reading
There are 8 facilities & loglevels exist 
dmesg -l loglevel 
dmesg -n <console log lelvel>
dmesg -s <siz e of buffer to be printed >

loglevel=	All Kernel Messages with a loglevel smaller than the
			console loglevel will be printed to the console. It can
			also be changed with klogd or other programs. The
			loglevels are defined as follows:

			0 (KERN_EMERG)		system is unusable
			1 (KERN_ALERT)		action must be taken immediately
			2 (KERN_CRIT)		critical conditions
			3 (KERN_ERR)		error conditions
			4 (KERN_WARNING)	warning conditions
			5 (KERN_NOTICE)		normal but significant condition
			6 (KERN_INFO)		informational
