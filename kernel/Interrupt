Interrupt:

Interrupt latency:
interrupt latency is the number of clock cycles that is taken by the processor to respond to an interrupt request.
These are procedures stored at specific memory addresses which are called when a certain type of interrupt occurs. 

The Cortex-M processors family has the NVIC that manage the execution of the interrupt.
What is NVIC in ARM Cortex?
The Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (NVIC) in the Cortex-M processor family is an example of an interrupt controller 
with extremely flexible interrupt priority management. It enables programmable priority levels, automatic nested interrupt support, 
along with support for multiple interrupt masking.
