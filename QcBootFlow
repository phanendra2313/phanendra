PBL,RPM from Boot ROM at 0x0
SBL1 (RPM SBL)  - download , authenticate & jump to SBL2
SBL2 (Krait PBL) - download, authenticate , krait out of reset & jump to SBL2 in IMEM and download TZ ,authenticate,execute TZ
                   jump back to SBL2, authenticate RPM, config DDR. Download & authenticate SBL3 ()
SBL3    : Load APPSPBL , authenticate & jump to APPSPBL
APPSPBL : Loads & jump to HLOS kernel. which loads Modem --> Enter TZ(PIL service) , authenticate Modem & exit TZ. 
          take Modem out of reset.  also takes LPASS & WLAN out of reset for audio and WLAN.



RPM processor starts executing PBL in boot ROM. Detects Flash device and downloads SBL1 to IMEM. SBL1 Authenticate&Loads SBL2
SBL1 takes krait out of reset and wait for signal from SBL2. 
SBL1 executes RPM firmware , downloaded by SBL2. if RPM formware authentication/donload fails, 
SBL2 reset MSM and enter into Boot ROM Emergency download mode.



PBL

• RPM processor starts executing PBL in boot ROM
• PBL determines cold boot or warm boot
• PBL increases RPM clock speed from XO to 60 MHz
• RPM processor start address is 0x0
• For cold boot, next step is to detect Flash device that chip will boot from, 
  based on the boot options
• When detected, PBL downloads SBL1 (RPMSBL) from Flash to System IMEM
• SBL1 authenticates SBL2 (Krait PBL)
• RPM uses Crypto Engine 4.0 to authenticate images
• SBL1 jumps to start of SBL2 (Krait PBL)

SBL1

• SBL1 configures MIMEM and GMEM, then loads and authenticates the SBL2 there;
  MIMEM is 192 KB, so when SBL2 grows, it will spill to GMEM
• SBL1 takes Krait out of reset
• SBL1 waits for signal from Krait SBL
• When desired signal is received, SBL1 executes RPM firmware, 
  which is downloaded by SBL2
• If RPM firmware image authentication/download fails, Krait SBL2 resets MSM and 
  enters into Boot ROM Emergency Download mode
  
  SBL2

• After being taken out of reset, Krait jumps to start of SBL2
 - Krait boot address is software-configurable via register APCS_START_ADDR
• SBL2 increases Krait clock speed
• SBL2 downloads TZ image to TZ-dedicated system IMEM
  - TZ image occupies at least 188 KB in system IMEM
  - TZ image sets up security environment (configures xPU, etc.)
• SBL2 authenticates TZ image
  - SBL2 uses CE-4.0 to perform authentication
• SBL2 downloads RPM firmware to Code RAM and authenticates it
• SBL2 configures DDR
• SBL2 sends RPM firmware-ready signal to RPM and lets RPM continue to 
  execute RPM firmware
• SBL2 jumps to SBL3

SBL3

• SBL3 bumps the system clock
• SBL3 loads and authenticates APPSBL
• SBL3 waits for the RPM process ready interrupt
• Once the interrupt is coming, SBL3 jumps to APPSBL 

SBL3/APPSBL/HLOS

• SBL3 (Krait SBL) loads and authenticates APPSBL and apps kernel
• Krait executes APPSBL and HLOS
• Krait loads and authenticates modem Hexagon firmware and 
  Hexagon software images, then takes them out of reset as needed
• Krait loads and authenticates LPA Hexagon image, then takes it out 
  of reset as needed
• Krait loads and authenticates DSPS ARM7 images, then takes them 
  out of reset as needed
• Krait loads and authenticates RIVA ARM9 images, then takes them 
  out of reset as needed
• Order of loading modem Hexagon, LPA Hexagon, and DSPS ARM7 
  can be decided by HLOS
