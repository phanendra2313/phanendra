1)
Min Reuirements:
Git 1.8.3.1 or greater     : $git --version
tar 1.27 or greater          : $ tar --version
Python 3.4.0 or greater: $ python –version for 
 
 Required packages to install for ubuntu:
      $ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib \
     build-essential chrpath socat cpio python python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect \
     xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping libsdl1.2-dev xterm
2) 
download poky source code: 
$git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky -b sumo
$cd poky

3) 
 Initialize the Build Environment: Run the oe-init-build-env environment setup script to define the OpenEmbedded build environment on your build host.
$ source oe-init-build-env

4)
By default, the target machine for the build is qemux86, which produces an image that can be used in the QEMU emulator and is targeted at an Intel® 32-bit based architecture. Further on in this example, this default is easily changed through the MACHINE variable in build/conf/local.conf so that you can quickly build an image for a different machines supported from meta/conf/machine/.
MACHINE="qemuarm64"

5)Layers Creation:
  I)check for layers existed with priority using below 
                $bitbake-layers show-layers 
                
 II)create a new layer using existed script of yocto-layer
                $./scripts/yocto-layer create new-layer
                Note: if we want to create layer with sample bb, please select Yes, so that it will create a simple Hellow world recipe(bb)
                
III)Add new layer in build/conf/bblayers.conf
                BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-new-layer"
                
Now we can able to see new layer created with $bitbake-layers show-layers  command. which was now started parsing by poky.

6)Start making build using bitbake <recipe name>


Note: You Can able to see all environmental variables & What all files are including while executing a bb can be seen with bitbake -e <recipe name>
