UEFI:
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)- a software program that connects a computer's firmware to its operating system (OS). 
UEFI is expected to eventually replace BIOS. UEFI provides faster boot time.
UEFI offers security like "Secure Boot", which prevents the computer from booting from unauthorized/unsigned applications
UEFI  is able to provide a GUI (navigation with mouse) as opposed to BIOS which allows navigation only using the keyboard.
