ARMv8-A ARM Architechture 
The ARMv8-A architecture is the latest generation ARM architecture targeted at the Applications Profile. 
The name ARMv8 is used to describe the overall architecture, which now includes both 32-bit execution and 64-bit execution. 
It introduces the ability to perform execution with 64-bit wide registers, 
while preserving backwards compatibility with existing ARMv7 software.
