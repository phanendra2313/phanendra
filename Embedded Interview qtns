12.Why is high memory zone not needed in case of 64-bit machine?
13.How to allocate a page frame from high memory?
14.In ARM, an abort exception if generated, if the page table doesn't
contain a virtual to physical map for a particular page. How
exactly does the MMU know that a virtual to physical map is present in
the pagetable or not?
    A Level-1 page table entry can be one of four possible types. The
1st type is given below:
    A fault entry that generates an abort exception. This can be
either a prefetch or data abort, depending on the type of access.
   This effectively indicates virtual addresses that are unmapped.
    In this case the bit [0] and [1] are set to 0. This is how the MMU
identifies that it's a fault entry.
    Same is the case with Level-2 page table entry.
15.Does the Translation Table Base Address (TTBR) register, Level 1
page table and Level 2 page table contain Physical addresses or
 Virtual addresses?
    TTBR: Contain physical address of the pgd base
    Level 1 page table (pgd): Physical address pointing to the pte base
    Level 2 page table (pte): Physical address pointing to the
physical page frame
    Since page tables are in kernel space and kernel virtual memory is
mapped directly to RAM. Using just an easy macro like
__virt_to_phys(), we can get the physical address for the pgd base or
pte base or pte entry.
