https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot

Universal Boot Loader is an open source, 
primary boot loader used in embedded devices to package the instructions to boot the device's operating system kernel.
It is loaded by the system's ROM or BIOS from a supported boot device, such as an SD card, SATA drive, NOR flash

U-Boot may be split into stages: the platform would load a small SPL (Secondary Program Loader), which is a stripped-down version of U-Boot,
and the SPL would do initial hardware configuration and load the larger, fully featured version of U-Boot.
Regardless of whether the SPL is used, U-Boot performs both first-stage (configuring memory controllers and SDRAM) and second-stage booting

U-Boot runs a command-line interface on a serial port.
Using the console, users can load and boot a kernel, possibly changing parameters from the default.
There are also commands to read device information, read and write flash memory, download files (kernels, boot images, etc.) 
from the serial port or network, manipulate device trees, and work with environment variables


U-Boot requires its boot commands to explicitly specify the memory addresses as destinations for copying data 
(kernel, ramdisk, device tree, etc.) and for jumping to the kernel and as arguments for the kernel
Because U-Boot's commands are fairly low-level, it takes several steps to boot a kernel, 
but this also makes U-Boot more flexible than other bootloaders, since the same commands can be used for more general tasks
