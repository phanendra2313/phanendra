Function Pointers:
Function pointers can be useful when you want to create callback mechanism, 
and need to pass address of an function to another function. 
They can also be useful when you want to store an array of functions, to call dynamically 

If a reference of a function is passed to another function as an argument to call it,  it will be called as a Callback function.

Unlike normal pointers, a function pointer points to code, not data. 
Typically a function pointer stores the start of executable code.
Ex: void (*fp)(int) = &fun; //assigning FP
    fp(10); //or (*fp)(10); // Calling fun through FP
    
 we can have an array of function pointers to store an array of functions, so that we call dynamically. Ex as below 
 void (*fun_ptr_arr[])(int, int) = {add, subtract, multiply};
 Call dynamically as below : 
 int ch;
 (*fun_ptr_arr)[ch](5,3) // Enter ch at run time to call required function in an array dynamically.
 
 Volatile:

 volatile is used when the value of variable is updated by external factor 
 (e.g. interrupts in micro-controller) and compiler is not optimized the volatile variable.
 
 Volatile tells the compiler to always load a variable from RAM rather than caching it in a CPU register. 
 This assures that a variable that's altered by hardware or an interrupt service routine, gets loaded and stored properly.
 
 Objects declared as volatile are omitted from optimization because values can be changed by 
 code outside the scope of current code any time.
 
 Use cases:
 1) peripherals contain registers whose values may change asynchronously to the program flow,
 So Memory-mapped peripheral registers has to declared with volatile to inform compiler to not optimize.
 2)if compiler optimization turned off,compiler has no idea that what all can be changed within the ISR function,
 so data modifying in ISR has to be declared with volatile.
 3)all shared global objects of muti threaded appplicatoin must also be declared volatile to prevent compiler optimization 
 from introducing unexpected behaviors
 
volatile int* volatile ptr;

pointer to Volatile:
volatile int myVolatileInt;
volatile int* ptr = &myVolatileInt;

Volatile pointer:
int* volatile ptr; 

Const Volatile Usecase:

In an embedded system, this is typically used to access hardware registers that can be read and are updated by the hardware, but make no sense to write to (or might be an error to write to).

An example might be the status register for a serial port. Various bits will indicate if a character is waiting to be read or if the transmit register is ready to accept a new character (ie., - it's empty). Each read of this status register could result in a different value depending on what else has occurred in the serial port hardware.

It makes no sense to write to the status register (depending on the particular hardware spec), but you need to make sure that each read of the register results in an actual read of the hardware - using a cached value from a previous read won't tell you about changes in the hardware state.
