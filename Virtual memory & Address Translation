Virtual memory, also known as the swap file, Memory management technique uses part of your hard drive to effectively expand 
your RAM, allowing you to run more programs than it could otherwise handle. 
But a hard drive is much slower than RAM, so it can really hurt performance.

A page table is the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store 
the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses. Virtual addresses are used by the program executed 
by the accessing process, while physical addresses are used by the hardware, or more specifically, by the RAM subsystem. 
The page table is a key component of virtual address translation which is necessary to access data in memory.

Role of the page table
In operating systems that use virtual memory, every process is given the impression that it is working with large, 
contiguous sections of memory. Physically, the memory of each process may be dispersed across different areas of 
physical memory, or may have been moved (paged out) to another storage, typically to a hard disk drive.
