how does communication between the device file and the driver take place? 
It happens via a pair of numbers referred to as major and minor numbers

The major number identifies the driver associated with the device, i.e., which driver is to be used. 
The minor number is used by the kernel to determine exactly which device is being referred to. 
For instance, a hard disk may have three partitions. Each partition will have a separate minor number 
but only one major number, because the same storage driver is used for all the partitions.
