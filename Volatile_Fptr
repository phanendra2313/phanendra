Function Pointers:
Function pointers can be useful when you want to create callback mechanism, 
and need to pass address of an function to another function. 

Unlike normal pointers, a function pointer points to code, not data. 
Typically a function pointer stores the start of executable code.
Ex: void (*fp)(int) = &fun; //assigning FP
    fp(10); //or (*fp)(10); // Calling fun through FP
    
 we can have an array of function pointers to store an array of functions, so that we call dynamically. Ex as below 
 void (*fun_ptr_arr[])(int, int) = {add, subtract, multiply};
 Call dynamically as below : 
 int ch;
 (*fun_ptr_arr)[ch](5,3) // Enter ch at run time to call required function in an array dynamically.
 
 Volatile:

 Objects declared as volatile are omitted from optimization because values can be changed by code outside the scope of current code any time
 
volatile int* volatile ptr;

pointer to Volatile:
volatile int myVolatileInt;
volatile int* ptr = &myVolatileInt;

Volatile pointer:
int* volatile ptr;
