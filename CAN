1990 - ISO11898 Standard
	   ISO 11898-1 for low and medium speed CAN
	   ISO 11898-2 for high speed CAN bus mostly using in automative 
	   0 - Dominant is a logical 0 (actively driven to a voltage by the transmitter
	   1 - Recessive is a logical 1 (passively returned to a voltage by a resistor) 

The wires are called CAN high and CAN low. When the CAN bus is in idle mode, both lines carry 2.5V. 
When data bits are being transmitted, the CAN high line goes to 3.75V and the CAN low drops to 1.25V, thereby generating a 2.5V differential between the lines.
	   
	   
CAN - 
Asynchronous Data Txssion ..  Serial commun protocal 
Messgage Based protocol - prioritization of messages done by identifier(in Hexa decimal format) -- high priority messages are transmitted first. 

Robust Protocal  - Since any node can send data to any other node. High priority identifier will wins the arbitration and sends information first.


A CAN network can be configured to work with two different message (or "frame") formats:
Standard frame format - support 11 Bit identifier  -  startofFrame(1) identifier(11)  Identifier extension bit (IDE)-0  Reserved bit(r0) DLC(Data Length code)(4) CRC(15) ACK  EOF(7)
Extended frame format - support 29 Bit identifier  -  startofFrame(1) identifier(11)  Identifier extension bit (IDE)-1  Reserved bit(r1,r0) DLC(4)CRC(15) ACK  EOF(7)

CAN has four frame types: 
Data frame  : a frame containing node data for transmission
Remote frame: a frame requesting the transmission of a specific identifier
Error frame : a frame transmitted by any node detecting an error
Overload frame: a frame to inject a delay between data or remote frame

Bus Terminator:
CAN Designed to use with shielded twisted pair cabling with 120 ohm impedence. So that trasmitter sends Dominent Bit and Rcver sends Ressisive Bit. 
if there is no Bus termination with 120ohm resistor, Due to Electro magnetic iterface .. Rcver sends Dominent bit.
